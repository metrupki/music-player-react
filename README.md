# Chill Music Player

A simple browser music Player playing some chillhop. The music id from chillhop.com and all the rights for the music belong to them.
I learned the basics of React and how to use React Hooks. I used SCSS to create modules for styling.

# Usage

The usage of the player works like any other music player. While clicking on the "Just Music" Button the Library opens and you can select the songs. Right now just lofi is available.

## Improvements

For future development it would be nice to add a feature to add and delete songs, so that every user can modify and create their own music library. A feature to create playlists would be nice as well. This could be implemented by adding Redux to the project, instead of passing the data down through the props of the components.

## Development

After cloning the project you can use yarn to run the following scripts:

#### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

#### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
