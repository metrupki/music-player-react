> A simple browser music Player playing some chillhop. The music id from chillhop.com and all the rights for the music belong to them.  
I learned the basics of React and how to use React Hooks. I used SCSS to create modules for styling.
### ‚ú® [Demo](https://chillmusic.netlify.app/)

## Install

After cloning the project you can use yarn to run the following scripts:

```sh
yarn
```

## Usage

```sh
yarn run start
```

```sh
yarn build
```
Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
